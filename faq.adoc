== Why do I need a GitHub account?

Brave Search currently supports goggles only when hosted on GitHub (public files and
gists) and GitLab (public files and snippets)

Goggledy integrates with GitHub Gists to access and permanently store your goggles


== Why do I need a personal access token?

Goggledy is a client side only application and therefore can't implement the
OAuth's authentication flow securely since client ID and secret can't be stored
in a protected environment. Because of that, Goggledy uses the authentication
token authentication provided by the GitHub API.
