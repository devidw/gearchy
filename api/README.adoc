= Brave Goggles Submit API Proxy

Brave Goggles can be submitted to:

[source,http]
----
POST https://search.brave.com/api/goggles/submit?url=
----

However, this is not possible from a front-end only application due to CORS
restrictions. 

To work around this, this is a simple API proxy that can be used to submit
Goggles without CORS restrictions.
