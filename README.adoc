NOTE: {product} uses multiple link:./app/#readme[experimental Vue features] if you encounter any
issues, please rise an https://github.com/devidw/gearchy/issues/new[issue].

{product} (https://gearchy.wolf.gdn/gearchy.mp3[pronounced like "gearky"]) has two main goals:

. Enhance the overall experience of interacting with
https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart[Brave Search Goggles]
. Lower the barrier for new users (especially non-technical users) to join the
community

This is done by:

* Providing a graphical interface to interact with Goggles, including an
interactive Goggle editor which does not require any knowledge of the Goggle's syntax
* Integrating with GitHub Gists as a Goggle hosting provider to permanently
store Goggles
* Integrating with the Brave Search API to automatically submit Goggles without
the need to reenter the Goggle URL on every change made to the Goggle
