GUI to create, edit and manage all your https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart[brave search goggles] with ease. Your goggles are stored as gists directly in your GitHub account.

NOTE: A GitHub account and a https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[personal access token] are required to use Goggledy.

Goggledy provides a nice graphical user interface to manage all your existing
goggle gists: view, edit and delete them. You can create new private or public
goggles directly from the GUI as well.
Goggledy comes with an advanced interactive goggle editor, which takes the editing experience to a whole new level.

The goal is to make it as easy as possible for a wide range of internet users to create
new goggles without having to be a developer.
